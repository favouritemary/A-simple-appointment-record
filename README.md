# A-simple-appointment-record

It is so amazing what programming can do these days. A set of instructions that can make our daya to day activities easy.

This simple project was designed to enable users do the following:

* Create and display their appointment records.
* Search for a specific appointment using either letters or numbers.
* Tally appointments by date or priority
